**Environment**

Everything that surrounds us is our environment. It includes all living and non-living things and nourishes us. The air, water, sunlight, animals, plants, and humans are various parts of the environment. It provides food, water, and shelter to us. It helps us to be born, grow, and develop. Human activities like cutting down trees and causing pollution can harm the environment. We must save our environment. The natural resources of the environment are keeping us alive. Without the blanket of the environment, we wouldn't be able to survive.
