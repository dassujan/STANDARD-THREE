### **12. What are the uses of gases?**  
- **Oxygen** is needed for breathing.  
- **Air** is used to fill balloons, tyres, and footballs.  
- **LPG** is used for cooking, and **CNG** is used as fuel in vehicles.  

### **13. Fill in the blanks:**  
1. Anything that occupies space and has mass is called **matter**.  
2. Matter exists in **three** different forms.  
3. Solids are generally **hard**.  
4. Liquids have a **fixed volume**.  
5. We cannot hold **air** in our hands.  

## **Chapter: Water as a Resource**  

### **1. What are the three states of water?**  
Water exists in three states:  
- **Ice (solid)**, **Water (liquid)**, **Water vapour (gas)**  

### **2. How can water change from one state to another?**  
- **Melting:** Ice changes into water.  
- **Evaporation:** Water changes into water vapour.  
- **Condensation:** Water vapour changes into water.  
- **Freezing:** Water changes into ice.  

### **3. What is evaporation?**  
The conversion of water into water vapour upon heating is called **evaporation**.  

### **4. What is condensation?**  
The conversion of water vapour into water on cooling is called **condensation**.  

### **5. What is the water cycle?**  
The **water cycle** is the process by which water circulates between the sky and the Earth in a continuous cycle. It includes **evaporation, condensation, and precipitation (rain, snow).**  

### **6. What are the types of impurities present in water?**  
Impurities in water are of two types:  
1. **Soluble impurities** – These dissolve in water, like salts and minerals.  
2. **Insoluble impurities** – These do not dissolve in water, like stones, pebbles, and sand.  

### **7. Why do we need to purify water?**  
Water contains impurities and germs that can cause diseases, so it must be purified before drinking.  

### **8. What are the methods of water purification?**  
1. **Boiling:** Kills harmful germs.  
2. **Water purifiers:** Remove impurities using filters.  
3. **Cloth layering method:** Filtering water using muslin cloth.  
4. **Chlorination:** Adding chlorine tablets to kill germs.  

### **9. What is rainwater harvesting?**  
**Rainwater harvesting** is the technique of collecting rainwater for future use. It helps in increasing groundwater levels and can be used for watering crops.  

### **10. What are two methods of rainwater harvesting?**  
1. **Rooftop rainwater harvesting:** Collecting rainwater in large tanks on rooftops.  
2. **Underground tank collection:** Storing rainwater in underground tanks connected by pipelines.  

### **11. How can we save water?**  
- Do not waste water while brushing.  
- Use leftover water for watering plants.  
- Fix leaking taps.  
- Use water judiciously in daily activities.  

## **Chapter: Sun as a Resource**  

### **1. Why is the sun called a natural source of energy?**  
The **sun is the major source of energy on Earth**. It gives us heat and light, which are essential for life.  

### **2. What is solar energy?**  
The energy we get from the sun is called **solar energy**.  

### **3. How do plants use sunlight?**  
Plants use sunlight, air, and water to make their food through a process called **photosynthesis**.  

### **4. What are the uses of solar energy?**  
- **Solar cookers** cook food using sunlight.  
- **Solar geysers** heat water.  
- **Solar panels** generate electricity.  
- Helps in drying clothes, crops, and food items.  

### **5. What are solar cells?**  
**Solar cells** trap sunlight and convert it into heat energy. Many solar cells together form a **solar panel**, which generates electricity.  

### **6. What are the benefits of solar energy?**  
- It **does not cause pollution**.  
- It is **freely available in nature**.  
- It reduces dependency on other energy sources.  

### **7. How does the sun affect seasons?**  
The Earth moves around the sun, and different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of sunlight. This causes **changes in seasons**:  
- **Summer:** Hottest season.  
- **Winter:** Cold season.  
- **Rainy (Monsoon):** Brings rain.  
- **Autumn:** Trees shed leaves.  
- **Spring:** Pleasant season with flowers.  

### **8. What are renewable sources of energy?**  
Sources of energy that can be used again and again are called **renewable sources of energy**. Examples:  
- **Solar energy** (from the sun)  
- **Wind energy** (from moving air)  
- **Hydro energy** (from water)  

### **9. What are non-renewable sources of energy?**  
These are energy sources that cannot be easily replaced. Examples:  
- **Coal**, **Petroleum**, **Natural gas**  

### **10. What is conservation of energy?**  
The way by which we **save energy and prevent its misuse** is called **conservation of energy**.  

### **11. How can we conserve energy?**  
- Switch off **lights and fans** when not needed.  
- Use **LED bulbs** instead of ordinary bulbs.  
- Use **solar panels** for electricity.  
- Prefer **public transport** over personal vehicles.  
- Do not leave the **TV, refrigerator, or other appliances** on unnecessarily.
